 * How does content get distributed in Decentraland?
 *
 * In order to retrieve information related to content in Decentraland, there is a series of public nodes,
 * catalysts, that contain all the information required to render the world, running the scripts associated
 * with scenes, and contact you with other persons around you.
 *
 * These two functions of catalysts are often referred to as the "content server" and the "comms server"
