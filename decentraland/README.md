# Decentraland

## Why does Decentraland exists?

The year is 2020. Humanity has strolled the past millenia towards an inmense amount of technological progress.

* We reached the moon, and came back.
* We discovered penicillin, conquered antibiotics, and are now at war with their strike-back.
* We can reach out to our dearest ones no matter where in the world they are, in a matter of milliseconds.
* We kept on resolving mysteries, and now have a lot more questions.

So, what are we doing now? What can we achieve that hasn't been achieved yet?

This is our vision for Decentraland, where are going, and how Decentraland fits in the grand schema of humanity... We hope you like it, and continue to embue it with your spirit, heart and work.

We consider helping Decentraland exist a big part of our life's work. We are building the first community-ruled successful virtual world economy, a politically-decentralized, economically-independent organism like the Web, ruled by its own users. A huge experiment on how to organize our lives, data, permissions, in a manner that doesn't require a Big Brother watching. An organization where the ones building tools for it don't think about "the users" as a glob of dumb persons. Attention in this pure-information space (a.k.a. "game") is required for this experiment to be succesful.

We have, for the first time in our lives, "commons-owned trusted database code". This is the first "trusted shared computer" the world have seen. Commons-owned means that nobody has root access. All reads and writes are ruled by a shared consensus of what the rules are. And if you don't like the rules, because this is voluntary participation, you are free to leave and spend your time and energy somewhere else.

## Core values

These are the fundamental beliefs of our organization, guiding the behavior of the organization as a whole. Our core values are a very important part of our culture, they define how we work, how we make decisions, what we look at when we join efforts with new participants and what we expect from our community.

* **Create with passion**: Weâ€™re excited about new technologies and the universe of possibilities they can take us to. We deeply care about making wonderful experiences.

* **Care about the future**: We do everything in our power to create positive changes in our society through the tools and experiences we build and enable. We project this sense of responsibility to the broader community of Decentraland.

* **Be transparent**: We believe that shared knowledge leads to autonomy, promotes trust and fosters growth. Decentraland will prevail based on its stewardship of the community and the relations it builds.

* **Done is better than perfect**: Plan and execute fast, and do it at the highest possible level of excellence. Learning from mistakes is better than losing opportunities by moving slowly.

* **Own it**: For any opportunity to improve something: make it happen. Don't wait for somebody else to come and solve the problem for you. 

* **Enjoy the ride**: Be excellent to each other, learn and grow through this experience.
